============

Multi-player [in progress] zombie game built with MySQL, Express, and NodeJS (The MEN stack).

I left out my settings.js file because it has private credentials in it. But here is the schema I used (a simple JS Object) to have my settings all in one file:

    "use strict";
    export default {
        user : "dat username",
        database : "not my database",
        password : "asswordp"
    }

Setting up your own server is easy! The following steps should help you create and setup your server.

1. Install an Ubtuntu 14.04 instance
2. Create your non-root user and give sudo permissions
3. Install a mysql server by running `sudo apt-get install mysql`
4. Install npm by running `sudo apt-get install npm`
5. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies
6. Login to mysql using the credentials you created
7. Run `database.sql` to create the database and tables
8. Set up Redis server on your machine! Make sure Redis is running
9. Run `babel-node server` to compile the code and start the server*

*Note: Eventually I will export a distribution model that does not require babel. If you do this on your own, use `node server.js --harmony` to start the server.

Game Status: [Under Development]

You can currently create an account, login, and navigate the routing. I am currently setting up the map system, and progress is going well. Expect to be able to move, and see other players moving in the next couple of weeks!
